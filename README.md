# drawbotista

This is a port of as much of the [DrawBot API](https://www.drawbot.com) to [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html) as possible/needed.

To do:
- Figure out how this should work from a scripting POV.
- set up as an installable module.
- I've only implemented very basic things so far. I've been more focused on getting this working than making it complete.
